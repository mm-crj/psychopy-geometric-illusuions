# psychopy-geometric-illusions
This is a repo for developing a python module for conducting psychophysical experiments, to measure the intensity of 2-d geometric visual illusions. The goal is to develop a system indepent binarys so that people can easily set up the experiment themselves.   
This repo will only contain the finished executables and other experimental details, follow the developement of the underlying geom_illusion_2d python package or creation of the binaries [here](https://github.com/mm-crj/geom_illusion_2d).

## To do list
[] Track all the used libraries and update the requirements.   
[] create and upload the whole python package to PyPi.   
[x] Find a suitable freezing package for 1-click excecutable creation. Probably can use  [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) as suggested [here](https://hackernoon.com/the-one-stop-guide-to-easy-cross-platform-python-freezing-part-1-c53e66556a0a)  
[] Test the v0.1 executable for windows.

## Installation
The support for 1-click executables with come in the order mentioned below.   
### Windows
### Ubuntu
### Fedora
### Arch-linux

## Required packages for using the experiment.
psychopy  
pandas  
wxpython  
pyyaml  
psutil  
msgpack  
gevent  
python-xlib  

Need to track the other libraries.

## Experiments that can be conducted

1. Muller lyer illusion experiments
2. Baldwin illusion experiment

In the future ponzo's illusion may be included.

version 0.1 yet to be released
