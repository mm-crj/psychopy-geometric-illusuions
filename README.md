# psychopy-geometric-illusions
This is a repo for developing a python module for conducting psychophysical experiments, to measure the intensity of 2-d geometric visual illusions. The goal is to develop a system indepent binarys so that people can easily set up the experiment themselves.

## To do list
[] Track all the used libraries and update the requitements.  
[] Find a suitable freezing package for 1-click excecutable creation.  
[] Test the v0.1 executable for windows.

## Installation
The support for 1-click executables with come in the order mentioned below.   
### Windows
### Ubuntu
### Fedora
### Arch-linux

## Required packages for using the experiment.
psychopy  
pandas  
wxpython  
pyyaml  
psutil  
msgpack  
gevent  
python-xlib  

Need to track the other libraries.

## Experiments that can be conducted

1. Muller lyer illusion experiments
2. Baldwin illusion experiment

In the future ponzo's illusion may be included.
